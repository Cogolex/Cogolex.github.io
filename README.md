A stratagem picker made to create random loadouts for Helldivers 2 videogame.

It has some limitations to provide some fairness:
- Only one backpack stratagem per loadout
- If there is a weapon that uses your backpack slot no backpack stratagems (and viceversa)
- Only one weapon stratagem (Except Expandable Anti-Tank and Commando)
- Only one "vehicle", including Mechs and Fast Recon Vehicle
- No limitations for Eagles, orbitals and Sentrys
- Only picks the 4 necessary stratagems for your loadout. Main, secondary weapons, grenades and Booster is for you to decide.
